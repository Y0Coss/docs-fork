## Objective

The purpose of this guide is to help OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes Service (MKS) users to migrate from an existing [Loadbalancer for Managed Kubernetes](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer-kubernetes) to a [Public Cloud Load Balancer](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer).

[Public Cloud Load Balancer](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer) is the default Load Balancer for MKS clusters using Kubernetes versions >1.30.

[Loadbalancer for Kubernetes](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer-kubernetes) is deprecated for MKS clusters using Kubernetes versions >1.31.

It explains the steps required to make this transition safely, minimising service interruptions. Finally, it provides recommendations on DNS management, in particular reducing the TTL, to optimise the propagation of changes and ensure a smooth migration.

> [!warning]
>
> As Loadbalancer for Kubernetes and Public Cloud LoadBalancer do not use the same solution for Public IP allocation, it is not possible to keep the existing public IP of your Loadbalancer for Kubernetes. Changing the LoadBalancer class of your Service will lead to the creation of a new Loadbalancer and the allocation of a new Public IP (Floating IP).

## Comparison

Below is a comparison between Load Balancer for Kubernetes and Public Cloud Load Balancer, highlighting their key differences and capabilities. Public Cloud Load Balancer introduce several size/flavor, you can find the detailed specifications on the [Public Cloud Loadbalancer webpage.](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/public-cloud/load-balancer/)

## Migration of your LoadBalancer

> [!warning]
>  
> Starting from MKS cluster using Kubernetes version **1.32**, any cluster upgrade attempt will be blocked if a service of type Loadbalancer relying on [Loadbalancer for Managed Kubernetes](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer-kubernetes) (IOLB) is still present in the cluster.
>  
> Action required**: Before upgrading, you must **migrate your services to the Public Cloud LoadBalancer (Octavia)** by following the steps described in this guide.  
>  
> If you attempt to upgrade without first migrating, an error will be returned, preventing the upgrade.
>

There is two way to move from the [Load Balancer for Kubernetes](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer-kubernetes) to a [Public Cloud LoadBalancer](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer), you can either **Migrate** or **Replace**.

Your existing LoadBalancer Service using [LoadBalancer for Kubernetes](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer-kubernetes) should have the following annotation:

```yaml
annotations:
  loadbalancer.ovhcloud.com/class: "iolb"
```

/// details | **Migrate**

Migrate from an existing [LoadBalancer for Kubernetes](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer-kubernetes) to a [Public Cloud LoadBalancer](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer) involves creating a new Load Balancer service using Public Cloud Load Balancer with the same labelSelector to expose your application. For a short period of time, your application will be accessible using both Load Balancers.

At this time you can perform a DNS switch and then delete the old Loadbalancer.

To migrate grom an existing [LoadBalancer for Kubernetes](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer-kubernetes) to a [Public Cloud LoadBalancer](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer), follow this steps:

### Step 1 - Create a new Load Balancer service

You need to create a new LoadBalancer service using the Public Cloud LoadBalancer while keeping the existing one active:

- Ensure that the new service has the same labelSelector as the old one so that it exposes the same application.
- You can set the annotation `loadbalancer.ovhcloud.com/class: "octavia"` for cluster <1.31 or remove it completely for cluster >= 1.31 as Octavia will be the one used by default.

**labelSelector**:

```yaml
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
```

**annotations**:

```yaml
annotations:
  loadbalancer.ovhcloud.com/class: "octavia" // if your cluster <1.31
```

Apply the new service with:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f your-service-manifest.yaml
```

This will create a new Public Cloud LoadBalancer with a new public IP

### Step 2 - Test Application access

Once the new LoadBalancer is created, get the public IPs of both services:

```yaml
kubectl get svc -o wide
```

You should see two LoadBalancer services pointing to the same application with different public IPs.

Test accessibility via both IPs:

```yaml
curl http://<OLD_LOADBALANCER_IP>
curl http://<NEW_LOADBALANCER_IP>
```

Both should return a successful response from your application.

### Step 3 - Perform a DNS switch

To perform a DNS switch, refer to [this part.](#perform-a-dns-switch)

### Step 4 - Remove the old Load Balancer service

Once you confirm that traffic is flowing through the new LoadBalancer and the old one is no longer needed, remove the old LoadBalancer service by deleting it:

```yaml
kubectl delete svc old-loadbalancer-service
```

///

/// details | **Replace**

Replace an existing [LoadBalancer for Kubernetes](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer-kubernetes) to a [Public Cloud LoadBalancer](/links/public-cloud/load-balancer) involves to modify the existing service and change the loadbalancer class from 'iolb' to 'octavia'. This will lead to Kubernetes reconciling the loadbalancer class by deleting the old one and create a new loadbalancer.

At this time you can perform a DNS switch using the new public IP.

> [!warning]
>
> Please note that during the deletion and creation process, your service will not be accessible.
>
> You can reduce this impact by lowering your DNS TTL duration, please refer to [this dedicated section](#perform-a-dns-switch).


### Step 1 - Edit your Service to change the LoadBalancer class to 'octavia'

```yaml
annotations:
  loadbalancer.ovhcloud.com/class: "octavia" // not required for clusters running kubernetes versions >= 1.31, you can just remove the annotation.
```

### Step 2 - Apply the change

> [!warning]
>
> The old LoadBalancer and IP will be deleted **permanently**, making services unreachable. Perform the DNS switch immediately with the new IP.
>

```yaml
kubectl apply -f your-service-manifest.yaml
```

### Step 3 - Perform a DNS switch

To perform a DNS switch, refer to [this part.](#perform-a-dns-switch)

///

## Perform a DNS switch

### Check the current TTL

By default, DNS servers cache the IP address of a domain for a period defined by the TTL (Time-To-Live).

A TTL that is too long can slow down the transition by forcing some users to wait several hours before accessing the new Load Balancer. To avoid this, we recommend temporarily reducing the TTL before updating the IP.

Before changing the TTL, it is important to know its current value. To do this, run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
dig yourdomain.com +noall +answer

yourdomain.com.             600     IN      A       17*.***.**.*4
```

Here, 600 corresponds to the TTL in seconds (i.e. approximately 10 minutes). This means that the DNS servers keep this IP in cache for this length of time before checking for an update.

### Lower the TTL before migration

To lower the TTL, follow these steps:

- Access your DNS management console.
- Find the A record (or CNAME) associated with your domain.
- Change the TTL of your A or CNAME record by reducing it to 300 seconds (5 min).
- Wait 24 to 48 hours for this new TTL to propagate.

> [!info]
>
> Why wait? Because DNS servers must first clear their caches before adopting the new TTL.

### Update the Load Balancer IP

Once the TTL reduction has been propagated :

- Replace the old IP with the one of the new Load Balancer in your DNS record.
- Thanks to the low TTL, users will quickly see the update.
- Check that the change is effective using the same **dig** command you used recently. You should see the new IP displayed.

### Restore TTL after migration

Once the transition has been validated and the old Load Balancer disconnected, reset the TTL to a higher value.
