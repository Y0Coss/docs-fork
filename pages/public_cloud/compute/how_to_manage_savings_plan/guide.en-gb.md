- Modify a savings plan.
- Automate the management of Savings Plans via the API or Terraform for greater efficiency and flexibility.

### Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud API](https://api.ovh.com/) (create your identifiers by consulting [this guide](/pages/manage_and_operate/api/first-steps))
- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account.
- Access to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB) or to the [OVHcloud API](https://api.ovh.com/)
- Be familiar with [Terraform] (/pages/public_cloud/compute/how_to_use_terraform) if you wish to use it.
- Be familiar with the principles of a [savings plan](...)

## Instructions

Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel] (https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB) and go to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section. Once you have selected your Public Cloud project, click on `Savings Plans`{.action} in the left-hand navigation bar under **Project Management**.

>>
> Via Terraform
>> To create a Savings plan, you will need at least 5 elements:
>> 
>> * The ID of your Public Cloud project.
>> * The flavour concerned by your Savings Plan
>> * The duration of your Savings Plan (in standard ISO 8601 format)
>> * The number of resources concerned.
>> * The name of your Savings Plan
>>
>> In our example, we are going to create a Savings Plan for 10 instances of type **b3-8**, for a duration of 1 month. Add the following lines to a file named *savings_plan.tf* :
>>
>> ```python
>> # creation of a Savings Plan
>> resource "ovh_savings_plan" "savings_plan_b3_8" {
>>   service_name = "<public cloud project ID>"
>>   flavor = "b3-8" # instance type or rancher/rancher_standard or rancher_ovhcloud_edition
>>   period = "P1M" #  P mandatory, number for duration and M for ‘month’, Y for ‘year’ ...
>>   size = 10
>>   display_name = "Savings_plan_simple_b3_8"
>>   auto_renewal = true # optional, ‘true’ to activate.
>> }
>> ```
>>
>> You can create your Savings Plan by entering the following command in your console:
>>
>> ```console
>> terraform apply
>> ```

### Modifying a Savings plan

>>
>> > [!api]
>> >
>> > @api {v1} /services GET /services
>> >
>> > You must enter the id of your Public Cloud project as a parameter in the **resourceName** field.
>>
>> You will obtain a list containing the id of your services as follows:
>>
>> ![Savings Plan services list](images/savings_plan_list_service.png){.thumbnail}
>>
>> You can use this route to check whether the service corresponds to the Public Cloud project concerned:
>>
>> > [!api]
>> >
>> > @api {v1} /services GET /services/{serviceId}
>> >
>> > With **serviceId** corresponds to the id retrieved in the previous route.
>>
>> You will obtain a list containing the id of your services as follows:
>>
>> ![Savings Plan services list](images/savings_plan_list_service.png){.thumbnail}
>>
>> Then look for the service concerned in the list and copy the **id**.
>>
>> You can find the id of your Savings Plan in the list of your Savings Plans obtained via the API:
>>
>> > [!api]
>> >
>> > @api {v1} /services GET /services/{serviceId}/savingsPlans/subscribed
>> >
>> > With **serviceId** corresponding to the id retrieved previously.
>>
>> You get a list of Savings Plan as follows:

>> > The number of resources can only be increased.
>>
>> > [!api] 
>> >
>> > @api {v1} /services POST /services/{serviceId}/savingsPlans/subscribed/{savingsPlanId}/changeSize
