## Objective

This guide explains the necessary steps to configure your environment after migrating from `Managed vSphere` to `VMware Cloud Director (VCD)`.  

These modifications are essential to ensure the proper functioning of your virtual machines and networks. 

## Requirements  

- Access to `VMware Cloud Director`.  
- You must have access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) and be technical administrator of the managed VMware vSphere on OVHcloud infrastructure.

## Instructions  

### Step 1: Update virtual machine network settings  

After migration, you need to update the network configurations of your `virtual machines (VMs)` by selecting **one** of the following options:  

- **Option 1: Set the network configuration to `DHCP`** *(Recommended)*  
   - Go to the network settings of each `VM`.  
   - Change the IP assignment mode to `DHCP`{.action}.

   - Make sure the `"Guest customization settings"`{.action} are set to `Disabled` before modifying the NIC settings.

- **Option 2: Update `Gateway CIDR` for each network**  
   - Update the `Gateway CIDR` to match the actual subnet used in each network.  
   - This step is required to maintain connectivity and avoid configuration conflicts.

### Step 2: Handling the IP addressing bug in `VCD`  

During migration, `VLANs` are pre-created with **placeholder `Gateway CIDRs`**, as the actual VM subnets are unknown beforehand.  

This can lead to IP assignment issues if not addressed post-migration.  

#### **Identified issue**  
- If a static IP is manually assigned to a `VM` and does not match the pre-configured `Gateway CIDR`, the assignment will fail.  
- You will not be able to create or update a `VM` with manual IP assignment outside the predefined `Gateway CIDR`.  

#### **Solutions**  

1. **Use `DHCP` mode** *(Recommended)*  
   - Setting all IP modes to `DHCP` works seamlessly, even if the OS is configured with a static IP.  
   - This approach is valid for both **`isolated networks`** and **`VM Networks`**.

2. **Manually update the subnet in `static mode`**  
   - Identify and configure the correct subnet manually for each network.  
   - There is no automatic method to retrieve these details.  

3. **Create a new `segment`**  
   - Customers can create a new `network segment` with the correct subnet.  
   - This solution works only if the customer has **a single** public IP range.
