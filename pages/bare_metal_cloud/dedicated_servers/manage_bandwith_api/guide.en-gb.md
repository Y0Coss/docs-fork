## Objective

Each of our dedicated servers includes a minimum public bandwidth of 500Mbps. In this guide, we explain how you can easily increase or decrease the bandwidth of a dedicated server.

## Requirements

- A [dedicated server](/links/bare-metal/bare-metal) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud API](/pages/manage_and_operate/api/first-steps)

## Instructions

### Find available services

Use the following API call to list all the available services for upgrade (or downgrade) and verify that the service you wish to upgrade/downgrade is listed:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /order GET /order/upgrade/baremetalPublicBandwidth
>

### Find the plan code

List available offers and find the **planCode** of your choice with the API call below:

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /order GET /order/upgrade/baremetalPublicBandwidth/{serviceName}
>

Enter the variables:

- serviceName: the name of your dedicated server, for example `ns1234567.ip-203.0.113.eu`

The `RESPONSE` field should display information similar to the following:
