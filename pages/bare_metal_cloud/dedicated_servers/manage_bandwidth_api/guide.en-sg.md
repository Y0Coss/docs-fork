## Objective

Each of our dedicated servers includes a minimum public bandwidth of 500Mbps. If you have specific download or mass distribution requirements, such as software updates, you can upgrade the bandwidth. And if you need less bandwidth, you can also downgrade to a lower bandwidth.

**In this guide, we explain how you can easily upgrade or downgrade the bandwidth of a dedicated server.**

> [!warning]
> Please note that this option is available on most dedicated servers, but not all. Although our servers come with a minimum public bandwidth of 500Mbps, the public bandwidth upgrade option is not available on all dedicated server ranges.
