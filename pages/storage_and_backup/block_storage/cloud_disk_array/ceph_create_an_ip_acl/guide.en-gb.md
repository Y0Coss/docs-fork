## Objective

This guide shows you how to create an IP ACL to allow access to your ceph cluster., using the OVHcloud Control Panel or the OVHcloud API.

## Requirements

- A [Cloud Disk Array](/links/storage/cloud-disk-array) solution
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) or to the [OVHcloud API](/links/api)

## Instructions

### Using web interface

First, log into your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) and click on `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action}. In the section called `STORAGE AND BACKUPS`, then on the `Cloud Disk Array`{.action} service.

Here you'll find the existing ACL in `IP access control`{.action}, by default there is no ACL.

Get your ip address.

```bash
admin@server:~$ ip -4 a
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    inet 123.123.123.123/32 brd 234.234.234.234 scope global eth0
      valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Add your IP.

And create the IP ACL.

After the pool creation, you are back to manager. You can see that cluster status has changed because the ACL is being created.

### Using API

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/ceph POST /dedicated/ceph/{serviceName}/acl
>
serviceName is the fsid of your cluster.

You can check ACL creation by listing ACL.

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/ceph GET /dedicated/ceph/{serviceName}/acl
>
Example:

```bash
GET /dedicated/ceph/98d166d8-7c88-47b7-9cb6-63acd5a59c15/acl
[
  {
    network: "123.123.123.123"
    id: 57054
    netmask: "255.255.255.255"
    family: "IPV4"
  }
]
```
