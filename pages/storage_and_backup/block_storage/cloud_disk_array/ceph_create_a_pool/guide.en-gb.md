### Using the OVHcloud Control Panel

First, log into your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) and click on `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action}. In the section called `STORAGE AND BACKUPS`, then on the `Cloud Disk Array`{.action} service.

Here you'll find the existing pools in `Pools`{.action}.

Enter a poolname, your pool needs at least three characters.

After pool creation you are back to manager, you can see that cluster status has changed because the pool is being created.

### Using the API

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/ceph POST /dedicated/ceph/{serviceName}/pool
>
serviceName is the fsid of your cluster.

You can check pool creation by listing pools.

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/ceph GET /dedicated/ceph/{serviceName}/pool
>
For example:

```bash
GET /dedicated/ceph/98d166d8-7c88-47b7-9cb6-63acd5a59c15/pool
[
{
  replicaCount: 3
  serviceName: "98d166d8-7c88-47b7-9cb6-63acd5a59c15"
  name: "rbd"
  minActiveReplicas: 2
  poolType: "REPLICATED"
  backup: false
},
{
  replicaCount: 3
  serviceName: "98d166d8-7c88-47b7-9cb6-63acd5a59c15"
  name: "testpool"
  minActiveReplicas: 2
  poolType: "REPLICATED"
  backup: true
  }
]
```
