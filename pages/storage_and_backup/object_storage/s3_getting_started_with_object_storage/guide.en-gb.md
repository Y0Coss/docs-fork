## Objective

This guide is designed to familiarise you with the management of your containers/objects.

**Learn how to create an Object Storage bucket and manage this.**

> [!primary]
>
> - If you are interested in the **Standard object storage - SWIFT API** storage class, follow this [guide](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/pcs_create_container)
> - If you are interested in the **Cloud Archive - SWIFT API** storage class, follow this [guide](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/pca_create_container).
>

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](/pages/public_cloud/compute/create_a_public_cloud_project) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager)
- An [Object Storage user](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/s3_identity_and_access_management) already created

## Instructions

### Preparation

/// details | To use the AWS CLI

Enter this command command depending on the method chosen:

> [!tabs]
> **Linux x86 (64-bit)**
>>
>> ```bash
>> user@host:~$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
>> unzip awscliv2.zip
>> sudo ./aws/install
>> ```
>>
> **Linux ARM**
>>
>> ```bash
>> user@host:~$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-aarch64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
>> unzip awscliv2.zip
>> sudo ./aws/install
>> ```
>>
> **Snap package**
>>
>> ```bash 
>> user@host:~$ snap install aws-cli --classic
>> ```

**Check installation**

```bash
user@host:~$ aws --version
```
> [!primary]
>
> If you need more information about AWS CLI installation, you should go [here.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
>

#### Collect Credentials

- You will need your user's Access key* and *Secret key*. You can access this information in the ‘Object Storage users’ tab in your Control Panel.
- You will also need your *url_endpoint*. If you have already created your bucket, you can access this information from the `My containers` tab, then in the details of your bucket. Otherwise, follow this [guide](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/s3_location).

#### Where to find the Endpoint URL of a bucket

Click on the name of your bucket to view its details and content:

![Bucket details](images/highperf-create-container-20220928091433895.png)

#### Configuration

You can either use the interactive configuration to generate the configuration files or manually create them.

> [!primary]
>
> To use the interactive configuration, run the following command:
> `aws configure`
>

The configuration file format in the aws client is as follows:

```bash
user@host:~$ cat ~/.aws/credentials

[default]
aws_access_key_id = <access_key>
aws_secret_access_key = <secret_key>

user@host:~$ cat ~/.aws/config

[default]
region = <region_in_lowercase>
endpoint_url = <url_endpoint>
s3 =
  signature_version = s3v4
```

Here are the configuration values that you can specifically set:

| Variable | Type | Value | Definition |
|------|:------|:------|:------|
| max_competitor_requests | Integer | **Default:** 10 | The maximum number of simultaneous requests. |
| max_queue_size | Integer | **Default:** 1000 | The maximum number of tasks in the task queue. |
| multipart_threshold | Integer<br>String | **Default:** 8MB | The size threshold that the CLI uses for multipart transfers of individual files. |
| multipart_chunksize | Integer<br>String | **Default:** 8MB<br>**Minimum for uploads:** 5MB | When using multipart transfers, this is the bit size that the CLI uses for multipart transfers of individual files. |
| max_bandwidth | Integer | **Default:** None | The maximum bandwidth that will be used to load and download data to and from your buckets. |
| verify_ssl | Boolean | **Default:** true | Enable / Disable SSL certificate verification |

For a list of endpoints by region and storage class, refer to [this page](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/s3_location).

#### Usage

> [!primary]
>
> If you have more than one profile, add `--profile <profile>` to the command line.
>

///

/// details | Using the OVHcloud Control Panel

To manage an Object Storage bucket, first log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) and open your `Public Cloud`{.action} project. 

///

#### Listing your buckets

> [!tabs]
> Via AWS CLI
>> ```bash
>> aws s3 ls
>> ```
>>
> Via OVHcloud Control Panel
>> Click on `Object Storage`{.action} in the navigation bar on the left and then on the `My containers`{.action} tab.
>>
>> ![My Dashboard containers](images/01-object-storage-bucket-listing.png)

#### Create a bucket

> [!tabs]
> Via AWS CLI
>> ```bash
>> aws s3 mb s3://<bucket_name>
>> aws --profile default s3 mb s3://<bucket_name>
>> ```
>>
> Via OVHcloud Control Panel
>> Click `Create Object Container`{.action} and select your storage class:
>>
>> ![Select your solution](images/object-storage-bucket-creation-step1.png)
>>
>> Select a deployment mode:
>>
>> > [!primary]
>> >
>> > OVHcloud provides multiple deployment modes to meet different needs in terms of resilience, availability, and performance. Each mode is optimized for specific use cases and offers varying levels of redundancy and fault tolerance.
>> >
>>
>> ![Select a deployment mode](images/object-storage-bucket-creation-step2.png)
>>
>> Select a region:
>>
>> > [!primary]
>> >
>> > Regions can vary depending on the chosen deployment mode.
>> >
>>
>> ![Select a region](images/object-storage-bucket-creation-step3.png)
>>
>> You must link a user to the bucket:
>>
>> ![Link to user](images/object-storage-bucket-creation-step4_1.png)
>>
>> To do this, you can either link an existing Object Storage user:
>>
>> ![Link to user](images/object-storage-bucket-creation-step4_2.png)
>>
>> You can view the user credentials by clicking on `View credentials`{.action}:
>>
>> ![view credentials](images/object-storage-bucket-creation-step4_3.png)
>>
>> Or you can create a new Object Storage user:
>>
>> ![Create an Object Storage user](images/object-storage-bucket-creation-step4_4.png)
>>
>> At this stage, you can decide whether or not to enable **versioning**.
>>
>> Versioning allows you to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. This feature helps **preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your buckets**, making it easier to recover from unintended user actions or application failures. By default, versioning is disabled on buckets, and you must explicitly enable it. Find more information about versioning on our [dedicated guide](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/s3_versioning).
>>
>> ![Enabling versioning](images/object-storage-bucket-creation-step5.png)
>>
>> You can now decide whether or not you wish to **encrypt your data** using [SSE-OMK (server-side encryption with OVHcloud Managed Keys)](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/s3_encrypt_your_objects_with_sse_c).
>>
>> ![Encryption](images/object-storage-bucket-creation-step6.png)
>>
>> Finally, name your bucket:
>>
>> > [!primary]
>> >
>> > Buckets' names are global. It's not possible to give the same name to two different buckets across all the OVHcloud regions.
>> >
>>
>> ![Container name](images/object-storage-bucket-creation-step7.png)
>>
>> Congratulations, your bucket is created:
>>
>> ![Result](images/01_object_storage-bucket_listing.png)

#### Uploading your files as objects in your bucket

/// details | Difference between storage class of type **standard** and **High performance**

Standard Storage Class:

- Designed for general-purpose storage with a balance of cost and performance.
- Suitable for workloads with moderate access frequency.
- Provides durability and availability but may have slightly higher access latency.
- Best for backups, archiving, and infrequently accessed data.

High Performance Storage Class:

- Optimized for low-latency and high-throughput workloads.
- Ideal for frequent and intensive read/write operations.
- Suitable for data analytics, AI/ML workloads, and real-time applications.
- Typically costs more than Standard storage but offers better performance.

///

> [!tabs]
> Via AWS CLI
>> **To upload an object:**
>>
>> ```bash
>> aws s3 cp /datas/test1 s3://<bucket_name>
>> ```
>>
>> > [!primary]
>> >
>> > The `aws s3 cp` command will use STANDARD as default storage class for uploading objects.
>> > To store objects in the High Performance tier, use the `aws s3api put-object` command instead, as `aws s3 cp` does not support the EXPRESS_ONEZONE storage class which is used to map the High Performance storage tier.
>> > To learn more about the storage class mapping between OVHcloud storage tiers and AWS storage classes, you can check our documentation [here](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/s3_location).
>> >
>>
>> ```bash
>> # upload an object to High Performance tier
>> aws s3api put-object --bucket <bucket_name> --key <object_name> --body /data/test1 --storage-class EXPRESS_ONEZONE
>>
>> # explicitly upload an object to Standard tier
>> aws s3api put-object --bucket <bucket_name> --key <object_name> --body /data/test1 --storage-class STANDARD
>> ```
>>
>> **By default, objects are named after files, but can be renamed**
>>
>> ```bash
>> aws s3 cp /data/test1 s3://<bucket_name>/other-filename
>> ```
>>
> Via OVHcloud Control Panel
>> Click on the `name of your container`{.action}:
>>
>> ![Go in bucket](images/go-in-bucket.png)
>>
>> Click on `Add objects`{.action}
>>
>> ![Upload file](images/upload-file.png)
>>
>> You can add a prefix to your object name. ( the object name is the same as the file name ) Select the storage class between **Standard** and **High performance**. Finally, select the file you are about to download and click on the `Import`{.action} button.
>>
>> ![upload file window](images/upload-file-window.png)

#### Downloading an object from a bucket

> [!tabs]
> Via AWS CLI
>> **Downloading an object from a bucket**
>>
>> ```bash
>> aws s3 cp s3://<bucket_name>/test1 .
>> ```
>>
>> **Uploading an object from one bucket to another bucket**
>>
>> ```bash
>> aws s3 cp s3://<bucket_name>/test1 s3://<bucket_name_2
>> ```
>>
>> **Downloading or uploading an entire bucket to the host/bucket**
>>
>> ```bash
>> aws s3 cp s3://<bucket_name> . --recursive
>> aws s3 cp s3://<bucket_name> s3://<bucket_name_2> --recursive
>> ```
>>
> Via OVHcloud Control Panel
>> Click on the `...`{.action} button on the object line and on `Download`{.action}.
>>
>> ![Download file from bucket](images/download-file-from-bucket.png)

#### Synchronising buckets

> [!tabs]
> Via AWS CLI
>> ```bash
>> aws s3 sync . s3://<bucket_name> # Synchronising local directory to the S3 bucket
>> aws s3 sync s3://<bucket_name> . # Synchronising S3 bucket to the local directory
>> aws s3 sync s3://<bucket_name> s3://<bucket_name_2> # Synchronising an S3 bucket to another one
>> ```

**Deleting objects and buckets**

> [!primary]
>
> A bucket can only be deleted if it is empty.
>

> [!tabs]
> Via OVHcloud Control Panel
>> **Deleting bucket**
>>
>> In the list of object storage containers, click on the `...`{.action} button on the containers line and on `Delete`{.action}.
>>
>> ![Delete bucket](images/delete-bucket.png)
>>
>> Click on `Confirm`{.action}.
>>
>> **Deleting objects**
>>
>> Go to the relevant bucket and click on the `...`{.action} button on the object line and on `Delete`{.action}.
>>
>> ![Delete file](images/delete-file.png)
>>
>> Click on `Confirm`{.action}.
>>
> Via AWS CLI
>> **Deleting objects and buckets**
>>
>> ```bash
>> # Delete an object
>> aws s3 rm s3://<bucket_name>/test1
>> # Removing all objects from a bucket
>> aws s3 rm s3://<bucket_name> --recursive
>> # Delete a storage area. To delete a bucket, it must be empty.
>> aws s3 rb s3://<bucket_name>
>> # If the compartment is not removed, you can use the same command with the --force option.
>> # This command deletes all objects from the bucket, then deletes the bucket.
>> aws s3 rb s3://<bucket_name> --force
>> ```
>>
>> **Deleting objects and buckets with versioning enabled**
>>
>> If versioning is enabled, a simple delete operation on your objects will not permanently remove them.
>>
>> In order to permanently delete an object, you must specify a version id:
>>
>> ```bash
>> aws s3api delete-object --bucket <NAME> --key <KEY> --version-id <VERSION_ID>
>> ```
>>
>> To list all objects and all version ID, you can use the following command:
>>
>> ```bash
>> aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket <NAME>
>> ```
>>
>> With the previous delete-object command, you will have to iterate over all your object versions. Alternatively, you can use the following one-liner to empty your bucket:
>>
>> ```bash
>> aws s3api delete-objects --bucket <NAME> --delete "$(aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket <NAME> --query='{Objects: Versions[].{Key:Key,VersionId:VersionId}}')"
>> ```
>>
>> > [!primary]
>> >
>> > If your bucket has Object Lock enabled, you will not be able to permanently delete your objects. See our [documentation](/pages/storage_and_backup/object_storage/s3_managing_object_lock) to learn more about Object Lock.
>> > If you use Object Lock in GOVERNANCE mode and have the permission to bypass GOVERNANCE mode, you will have to add the `--bypass-governance-retention` option to your delete commands.
>> >

**Manage tags**

> [!tabs]
> Via AWS CLI
>> **Setting tags on a bucket**
>>
>> ```bash
>> aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket <bucket_name> --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=myKey,Value=myKeyValue}]'
>> aws s3api get-bucket-tagging --bucket <bucket_name>
>> ```
>>
>> ```json
>> {
>>   "TagSet": [
>>     {
>>     "Value": "myKeyValue",
>>     "Key": "myKey"
>>     }
>>   ]
>> }

>> ```
>>
>> ```json
>> {
>>   "TagSet": [
